# Robust Private Neural Network

- Square Attack
- SimBA
- PNet

- Larger ASR (Attack Success Rate)
- Fewer Queries
- Smaller $\ell_2$ perturbation norm: Imperceptible

- Quantization
- The networks on MNIST, CIFAR10, and medical datasets are quantized into 8 bits, 10 bits,
and 16 bits respectively.
